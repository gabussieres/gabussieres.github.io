    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>I am a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, pursuing a Specialist in Computer Science and a Minor in Psychology. My interests include functional programming, human-computer interaction, full-stack development, video game design, and cognitive psychology. I grew up in Woodstock, Ontario and was educated in a French school system. At Ecole Secondaire Notre Dame &#40;secondary school&#41;, I participated in the High Skills Major in Non-profit services, as well as the student government where I took the role of Minister of Finance and Secretary. My admiration for mathematics and programming led to my studies in Computer Science.</p>

As well, he assumed a leadership role during classroom collaborative assignments, often as the problem-solver of the group.</p>
