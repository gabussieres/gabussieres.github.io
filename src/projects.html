                <li>Invited to work with Steve Engels, a senior lecturer at the University of Toronto, to integrate new technology into the Royal Ontario Museum.
                <li>Developed a photo booth with a partner using a Kinect V1 Sensor and Unity3D.
                <li>Wrote scripts in C#. Functionalities implemented include changing outfits, changing the background, saving photos, and sending those photos to museum visitors via email.
                <li>Communicated weekly with Engels for brainstorming. Presented our work every month to employees at the Royal Ontario Museum, including the CEO and the project manager.
                <li>The Royal Ontario Museum has decided to continue working with our group and offered to demo our projects in exhibits and events.</li>
